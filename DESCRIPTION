Title: Reconstructing tree growth and carbon accumulation with stem analysis data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Wenhua Xiang, Huili Wu

Description: This package performs a number of standard tasks on input stem analysis data.
    (i) Age class determination.
    (ii) The cumulative growth, mean annual increment, and current annual increment of DBH with bark, tree height, and stem volume with bark are estimated. 
    (iii) Tree biomass and carbon storage estimation from volume and allometric models are calculated. 
    (iv) Height-diameter relationship is fitted with nonlinear models, if DBH or tree height are available, which can be used to retrieve tree height and DBH. 
    These tasks can be performed independently or in combination, and result in output tables and graphics. This package is easily applied to stem analysis for any tree species.
